This folder contains the working version of ShMOW that runs on my netbook.

To do:

- Support for floating window exceptions.
  - Mouse commands to move/resize for floaters.

- Update window titles in tab bar automatically. 
  - In start() look at while loop and maybe add a for loop to go through all clients and update their titles (not sure of the right function, draw()? update_current()? update_title(Client c*)?)

- Integrate status bar a la dwm into window tab bar.
- Fix tab bar title sizing issues.
- Add keyboard command to hide tab bar completely. 
- Add keyboard command to "reset" window tab bar when things go bad.

- Add ability to start WM without having a terminal held open.
