This folder contains the working version of ShMOW that runs on my netbook.

To do:

- Support for floating window exceptions. (Transient Window fields)
  - Mouse move/resize for floaters.

- Create global Drawable as the master tab bar. Stop "refresh" flicker from drawbar().
- Fix tab bar title sizing issues.
  - Make focus tab larger, unfocused smaller.

- Add keyboard command to hide tab bar completely. 
- Add keyboard command to "reset" window tab bar when things go bad.

- Add ability to start WM without having a terminal held open.
